    <h2>About Roger</h2>
    <img class="photo" src="images/dad.jpg" />
    <p>Roger has been involved with woodworking all
    of his life. He started out working with his father in their
    basement shop. One early memory is making various items from
    a load of scrap wood that his father had obtained from his
    place of business.</p>
    <p>Roger and Judy started collecting antiques
    when they lived in upstate New York primarily buying antiques
    that needed restoration and refinishing. In many cases
    restoration involved making parts that were damaged or
    missing. Later Roger became interested in building pieces of
    furniture. His interests were primarily in building period
    pieces especially from the Sheraton, Heppelwhite and
    Chippendale periods. He continues to enjoy using the period
    characteristics in designing pieces that provide
    functionality for today's environment. In
    recent years he has built contemporary pieces designed for
    family members.</p>

    <h2>About Judy</h2>

    <p>Judy has always concentrated on providing the
    design concepts and finishing techniques. One of the most
    memorable challenges was gold leafing an oval picture frame.
    She used the classic techniques that require such items as
    rabbit hide glue, gesso, and of course, gold leaf.</p>

    <p>Judy began her career as a
    psychologist/educator working with developmentally delayed
    children. She has been a middle school science teacher, and
    for the last ten years prior to retirement was technology
    coordinator at a high school.</p>
